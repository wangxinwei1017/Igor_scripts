updates 26/27 01 2017 (Tom)

OS GUI change name of 1st button
OS Parameter table - now checks if a table exists, in which case it just shows that rather than overwriute
OS Roi Manual place - now allows to use edge pixels.But it will give an out of range bug. This could be fixed with endless if clauses so I didnt do that. It works
		- also added a few linescan exception clauses (if nY==1)
OS Traces and Triggers -now also extracts the stim artifact and displays under traces
		- also now only plots the 1 in 20 trigger thing if Triggermode is left unchanged at 1. otherwise it shows the triggermode skips
		- also fixed a ROI rescaling bug when coming out of correlation ROI proc with bin>1
		-also inverts the trigger channel as needed on our scopes
OS Averaging - now also averages the stim artifact and displays
OS Event finder	-updated like Averaging function to also show the Stim Artifact
OS Export - added a note that the STimaftifact waves need to be also exported (not implemented)
OS Traces and Triggers added an override for the GeoC function if linescan (GeoC fails if nY==1)
OS LineScanFormat - new prodecure that converts any scan to an nY == 1 and displays X vs time as image. the output then is compatible
		with the rest of the GUI functions.
OS GUI-added new Step 0 for linescan.Renamed RF for Kernel fornow. Need to still add kernel script
OS_LaunchCellLab -fixed the Light Artifact issue so now can see the saw data. also there is a little hack so that it allows to use non square scans
		by now expanding the data given to it to a square.
OS_LED_Kernel - new function added. Also uses the NoiseArray4LEDs.ipf file
 
 2017 02 27
 
 OS_parametertable - added "Skip_First_trigger"
 OS_TRaces and TRiggers - can now skip the 1st trigger

2017 04 19

OS_detrend now spits out a Stack_Ave and it kills the Light afrifact. It also kills the 1st frame
OS_TriggersandTraces nbow uses Center of Mass not Geometric Center - this created a conflict with the SARFIA code for get IPL position
 --> so the same fix is also in OS_KernelMap which is the main function that uses the IPL position
OS_LEDNoise now plots many more maps when called, and also has a hidden OS_PlotKernels(roinumber) function

2017 04 21
OS_LEDNoise killed a redundant read from the table (KernelSD Hist thingy)
OS_TracesandATriggers now reads the light artifact from the original data not the detrended one
Added OS_Skittles which can do Skittles kernels
OS_3D thing now reads CoM and auto-reads Sutter coordinates

 
OS update 2018 02 10

// GUI a bit reformatted

// Added Parameter Table Kill button. That deletes the OS_Parameters wave. Only works if the window is closed for now

// Detrend renamed Preformatting (as does more than just detrend)
// Detrend itself can be switched off in Parameters under Detrend_Skip @Takeshi

// Implemented multiplane switch ("nPlanes" in Parameter table, default 1) @Fil, @Phil.
	 Triggers when Preformatting (former detrend button)

// Trace and Triggers now accepts the "Skip_First_Triggers" and "Skip_Last_Triggers" arguments @Phil. 
	Enter the number of triggers to be skipped. Default 0. 
	To execute, need to rerun Trace and Triggers if changed
	
// Added ROI-K button (@Mingyi). That's fro ROI-Kernel. It takes the z-norm trace from ROI0 (put only 1 ROI for this)
	and backtriggers the entire datastack against it. It shares some arguments from Parameter table with
	the Kernel function: 
	- Noise_FilterLength is used as half the length in the ROI Kernel
	- Noise_EventSD is used exactly as is also in ROI Kernel
	In addition, there is a smooth argument which makes the Roi Kernels prettier:
	- ROIKernelSmooth, default = 1 (set to 0 to remove, higher to smooth more)
	
// Added Sweep Button (Skittles only, @Phil)
	This decodes the Sweep from Skittles Data. Make sure to set Triggermode to 1 (not 19) for this, 
	still skip the 1st trigger, get the Averages (which will look silly) and the press Sweep to get the tuning.

// Added Swoosh Button (Skittles only, @Phil)
	This is the Swooshmap as Phil had already, except that now the swoosh positions are already in the script
	so no need to load extra. TBC
	
OS update 2018 02 11
	
// Enhanced ROI-K function
	Now also calculates Crosscorrelation functions
	Takes more than one ROI - all will be relative to Seed ROI as defined in OS_Parameters (last entry)
	Plots the Other ROI Kernel and CrossCorrs against time
	--> try setting more than 1 ROI altering the Seed ROI
	
	
OS update 2018 02 12
OS update 2018 02 12

// Added 8 bit export of raw data button	and of AveraageStack. Both are Y flipped	@Phil
// Also fixed a the Detrend_Skip bug @Takeshi
// Traces and triggers no longer inverts the Trigger Channel but insteads looks for upside down triggers @Takeshi
	
	
OS Update 2019 04 04

Major update
- fixed lots of niggles and annoyances
- Cleaned Parameter Table
- Added STRF scrip
- added Takeshi's Registration Script
- added Takeshi's SD ROI script


OS Update 2021 June ish
- added the OS_Bars function for Simen, but it's not on the GIU yet
	
OS Update 2021 08 27 (there have been a few logs skipped it seems!)
- MAIN: Simplified detrend, reducing duplicate commands to save memory, and added option to skip efficiently
- Cleaned up Corr ROI routine, and enabled a "skip" of the ROI placement when corr min == 1 (much faster that way)
- cleaned up Averaging routine (was leaving crap behind)
- AverageStack now autosaves, and save button on detrend panel enabled
- set OS parameters default to useful numbers

# Igor_scripts
Repository for the standard Baden lab OS scripts

# Installation
Simply drag and drop the User Procedures and Igor Procedures into the Igor Pro 9 User Files, which by default can be find under `C:\Users\user\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files\`. 

Note: There's no longer any need to mess around inside `C:\Program Files\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 Folder\` anymore, as Igor 9 seems perfectly handle importing the files correctly from the path above.
